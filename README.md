# 🛡️ AI TrustShield – Real-Time Guardrails for Trustworthy AI

🔗 **Live Demo:**
👉 [https://ai-trust-guard.vercel.app/](https://ai-trust-guard.vercel.app/)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**AI TrustShield** is a full-stack web application designed to build **real-time guardrails for trustworthy, ethical, and responsible AI usage**.
It analyzes AI prompts and responses to detect **misuse, hallucinations, bias, harmful content, and prompt injection attacks**, and assigns a **Trust Score (0–100)** with clear, explainable warnings.

This project aligns strongly with **AI safety, cybersecurity, and CyberPeace principles**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern AI systems often:

* Produce hallucinated or misleading information
* Are vulnerable to prompt injection and misuse
* Lack transparency and explainability
* Can be exploited for scams, hate, and cybercrime

There is no universal **real-time safety layer** that evaluates AI outputs before users trust them.

---

## 💡 Solution

AI TrustShield acts as a **middleware safety layer** between users and AI systems by:

* Scanning prompts for malicious intent
* Analyzing AI responses for risk factors
* Generating a **Trust Score (0–100)**
* Providing **explainable AI warnings**
* Supporting a **CyberPeace Mode** to block harmful content

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* 🔍 AI Output Risk Detection (toxicity, bias, hallucination)
* 🧠 Prompt Injection & Jailbreak Detection
* 📊 Trust Score Engine (0–100)
* 🧾 Explainable Risk Warnings
* 🛑 CyberPeace Mode (hate, scams, cybercrime prevention)
* 📈 User-friendly Dashboard UI
* 🌐 Scalable & API-ready architecture
